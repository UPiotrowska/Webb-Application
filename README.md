# Webb-Application
This project is focused on the deployment of a custom web application using Azure services. The project involves the creation of an Azure web app and deploying a container, designing a custom web application, creating a two blog post, creating a Key Vault, and a self-signed certificate. It also involves the configuration of a front door and the analysis and configuration of WAF rule sets, including the creation of custom WAF rules. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate the effective use of Azure services in building secure and scalable web applications. The instructions and code provided in this repository can serve as a reference for anyone interested in deploying a web application on Azure and implementing advanced security measures.
