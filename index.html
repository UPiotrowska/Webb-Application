        <div class="scrollable-content" style="height: 300px; overflow-y: scroll;">
        <p> You might be wondering about the name of my blog, but don't worry, I'm here to tell you all about it. With almost two decades of experience in the restaurant and hospitality industry, I've seen it all. I've been a host, a server, an executive chef, a wine director, and I even opened my own restaurants. Trust me when I say that I know this industry inside and out, from the front of house to the back of house, and where the industry scalatons are hiding in the closets.
            <br><br>
            Nowadays, everything is moving online, and the restaurant industry is no exception. We take online payments, manage payroll online, ship our products, and send food through delivery services. But, what many of us fail to take seriously is the threat of cybercrime, and the consequences of neglecting it can be catastrophic. That's where this blog comes in. I'm here to keep you updated and informed on the latest cybersecurity threats and provide you with the tools and resources you need to secure your organization.
            <br><br>
But hey, it's not all about the serious stuff here. I'll also be spilling the tea with some juicy industry gossip, so you can count on me to keep things interesting! So, grab a cup of coffee (or a glass of wine), and let's get started on our journey towards a safer and more secure restaurant industry. 
And let's start Securing The Menu!

                <h3>NCR ransomeware attack</h3>
                <h4>pos ncr ransomeware</h4>
                <div class="scrollable-content" style="height: 300px; overflow-y: scroll;">
                <p>In June 2021, the global technology solutions provider, NCR Corporation, 
                   suffered a devastating ransomware attack by the notorious BlackCat hackers. 
                   The attackers used a sophisticated malware variant, TripleM, to infiltrate NCR's systems, encrypting the company's data and demanding a ransom for a decryption tool.
                   <br><br>
                   Now, you might be thinking, why should I care about this cyberattack? Well, let me tell you why. As someone who has worked in the food/restaurant/hospitality industry, I know how much NCR technology is used by businesses like yours and mine. Whether it's a small mom-and-pop restaurant or a giant corporation, NCR is everywhere. In fact, the company reported an annual revenue of $7.8 billion, with recurring revenue accounting for 62% of all revenue in 2022. This breach is a cause for concern because it affects all of us as consumers. If you've ever used NCR to process payments at a restaurant, reserve a hotel room, or place an order online, your personal information could be at risk.
                   <br><br>
                   The consequences of this attack were significant for NCR's clients, many of whom rely on the company's technology solutions for their daily operations. Customers couldn't place orders, restaurants couldn't take payments, employees couldn't clock in, and managers had no idea how much inventory they had. This breach affected everyone who interacts with NCR's technology.
                   But what happened after the attack? At first, NCR refused to pay the ransom, and it was unclear how much data was leaked and what the hackers had accomplished. As the attackers threatened to publish the stolen data, NCR didn't release any further statements, leading to speculation that negotiations may be underway.
                   <br><br>
                   The lesson we can learn from this attack is that the restaurant/food industry is not immune to cyberattacks, and new threats are constantly emerging. As restaurant owners, we need to take steps to mitigate risks, such as employing basic-but-comprehensive layered security best practices, prioritizing cybersecurity measures, and remaining vigilant against the evolving threat landscape. It's essential to educate our employees on cybersecurity and to take extra security precautions to protect our businesses and our customers' data.
                   So my fellow restaurant owners, let's learn from this attack and improve our security measures. We can never be too careful when it comes to protecting our customers' information.

                <h3>Angler Phishing on the rise</h3>
                <h4>Angler Phishing scam</h4>   
                <div class="scrollable-content" style="height: 300px; overflow-y: scroll;">
                <p> Are you familiar with phishing attacks? You might think you know all about them, but cybercriminals don't sit still. They're constantly evolving and developing new, more sophisticated tactics to achieve their goals. And one of the latest and most dangerous trends in the world of cybercrime is angler phishing. 
                    <br><br>
                    So, what exactly is angler phishing, and why is it gaining such a following? Unlike traditional phishing attacks, which rely on malicious emails with attachments or links, angler phishers use social media platforms to target their victims. And they're not always easy to spot. In fact, their methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it harder for even the savviest social media users to protect themselves.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, if you've ever complained about a service on social media and received a response offering to help, you could be the perfect target for an angler phishing attack. The attacker creates a fake profile and poses as a customer care agent, offering to resolve your issue. During the interaction, the attacker may ask for personal information or direct you to a fake site where you're asked to input sensitive details like your banking information.
                    And here's the kicker: financial institutions are the most common targets of angler phishing attacks. But that doesn't mean you're safe if you don't work with a bank or other financial institution. Attackers use these methods on all social media channels, and anyone can become a victim.
                    <br><br>
                    So, why are angler phishing attacks so effective? The answer lies in the expectations of social media users. Most people assume that when they complain online, their company's customer representative will contact them. And when that response is slow to arrive, angler phishers swoop in to offer assistance, leveraging their victims' frustrations to their advantage.
                    Can you take any steps you can take to protect yourself? Be cautious and verify the accounts that contact you. Don't give up sensitive information to strangers, and don't be afraid to ask questions. A legitimate account will always be willing to redirect you to an official website, email address, or corporate number. With a little vigilance, you can keep yourself safe from even the most sophisticated angler phishing attacks.
